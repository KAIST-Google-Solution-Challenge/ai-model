## Run

Download [pre-trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jo4JT5E21U-1f10tgy1dfW6S8n9I3pDs/view?usp=share_link) or Execute all code blocks to train model.

Make directory in google drive and Save these files in that directory.

Then, Set the path as your directory path in each ipynb files("conversation_classifier.ipynb" and "Inference_Server.ipynb") and run codes.

>**conversation_model.ipynb**

We trained and tested the phone scam detection model using KoBERT and FSS phone scam dataset.

>**colab_api_server.ipynb**

We implemented api server that detects phone scam for a given sentence and returns the result to the main server.

>** conversation_data_set.xlsx

We gathered and pre-processed positive and negative phone (scam) data.
